# CCLR-DL: Hybrid Feature Selection and Forecasting for High-Dimensional Time Series

This repository contains the full implementation of CCLR-DL (Comprehensive Cross-Correlation and Lagged Linear Regression Deep Learning), a hybrid framework combining statistical models and deep learning for feature selection and healthcare demand forecasting.

    📝 This code supports the experiments and results described in the article:

    Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, Volume 272, 2025, 109057, ISSN 0169-2607, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2025.109057. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260725004742)

## 🔍 Overview

CCLR-DL is a three-phase pipeline designed to:
- Select meaningful predictors from high-dimensional multivariate time series using lagged regression and Granger causality.
- Forecast future values using state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g. LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM).
- Enhance interpretability and accuracy of long-term forecasting, especially in clinical domains.

## 📊 Dataset

Due to ethical and legal restrictions, the original clinical dataset (based on 6.3 million patients over 10 years) cannot be made public.

To promote transparency and reproducibility:
- This repository includes a synthetic dataset of 1,000 time series, generated using random resampling techniques.
- The synthetic data replicates key structural characteristics (e.g., sparsity, temporal granularity) of the real data without disclosing any sensitive information.
- 🔒 Real data is hosted on secure institutional servers and cannot be exported nor used without consent.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
   
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/cclr-dl.git
    cd cclr-dl

### 2. Create environment
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run an example with synthetic data
    
    python main.py --config configs/example.yaml

## 🧠 Methodology Highlights

- Phase 1 – Feature Selection (Lagged MLR): Identifies non-collinear predictors that best explain the target using forward stepwise regression. It outputs the file "BEST_features_ts350.xlsx" with the best features for each lagging period. 
- Phase 2 – Granger Causality Test: Ensures that selected predictors statistically G-cause the target, increasing explainability. (predictors must be selected from lagged file "BEST_features_ts350.xlsx").
- Phase 3 – Deep Learning Forecasting: Multiple RNN-based architectures are trained using selected features. The best model is selected based on RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. (predictors must be selected from lagged file "BEST_features_ts350.xlsx").

## 📈 Results Summary
- CCLR-DL outperforms baseline models (univariate, random, SHAP) for long-horizon forecasting (≥ 14 days).
- BiLSTM models showed the best overall performance.
- The feature selection phase enhances both performance and interpretability, especially relevant in the healthcare domain

## 🌍 General Applicability

Though developed for healthcare demand modeling, the method is suitable for any high-dimensional time series problem, such as:
- Financial forecasting
- Industrial sensor analysis
- Environmental monitoring
